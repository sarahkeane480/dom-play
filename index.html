        <p>This is an example of using onclick events to change the background color of paragraphs. When you click one
            of the lines below, it will highlight all of the lines that should be read by that actor, and remove
            highlighting from all other lines.</p>

        <p>To do this, I created a function named highlightActor(actor) that loops through each line of the play and
            checks if they were for the actor who's name was passed into the function. If it is for them, it highlights
            the line, but if not, it removes any highlighting.</p>

        <p>Then, I created a for loop that adds an onclick event listener to each span containing a line, which then
            calls highlightActor(actor) whenever the line is clicked. The actor argument is then replaced by the name of
            the actor who's line was clicked. (these are identified by the "data-actor" attribute in each span</p>

        <p>And after all that, the lines will highlight correctly. That's sure to help these actors focus on what they
            do best - acting!</p>

                    The absolute worst poetry was written by

                    It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it
                    was destroyed when the Earth was.
